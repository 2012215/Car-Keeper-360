# Car Keeper 360

Carkeeper 360 is being designed with a few key objectives in mind. This project is a car safety, security and maintenance helping gadget. We want the user of this gadget to feel they can always keep an eye on their vehicles, especially when their vehicle might not be within their own reach such as when parents give their vehicles to their children to drive, or when a manager gives out their fleet to drivers on the road, it is always best for the owner to keep an extra eye. For that, this project uses Haar Cascade as ML face detection during a live stream to let them know who is in the car, or if they want to find out the location of their vehicle, the built-in GPS will let the owner know.
Itâ€™s not just safety and security based however, the Carkeeper 360 application will let the user set reminders for maintaining their car, such as being able to set reminders for when to change their engine oil, get their car tires or car checked regularly. 
We believe this product can greatly help people in our country as the security and road infrastructure here is not ideal for cars.
